# Student List Pagination and Filtering

## Overview

This project demonstrates data pagination and filtering using a list of student profiles. It allows users to search for students by name or email, navigate through pages of student data, and see relevant details in a user-friendly format. This was my second project in the [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) full stack JavaScript techdegree. This application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Pagination**: Display students in manageable chunks (9 students per page) with navigation controls to switch between pages.
- **Search Functionality**: Filter students by name or email using a search bar.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable layout for various screen sizes, enhancing usability on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
